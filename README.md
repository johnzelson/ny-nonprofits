# ny-nonprofits
 This app presents data on Nonprofits in New York State.  
     
    The core dataset was collected from the IRS in July 2024 with supplemental information
    on cities and demographics from a variety of other sources, like the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) and 
    [Google Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/).  
    
    It's an early draft of a curiosity and learning project, but demonstrates some 
    potential for creating a way to layer information about a community.  
    
    This app is an offshoot of an effort to look at more detailed info on nonprofits
    in a local area:
    - [Nonprofits in Cortland, NY](https://local-nonprofits-jzelson.streamlit.app/) 
    - [Visualization of People connections in Cortland](https://johnzelson-local-nonprofits-graph-streamlit-app-zuq6hl.streamlit.app/)

    It would be interesting to make an app that is easily refreshed and 
    extended that would enable analysis and discovery about community. (language)
